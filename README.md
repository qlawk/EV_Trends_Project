# Project goal 
We examined the current landscape of electric vehicles in Washington state, projected future trends, and explored the correlation between electric vehicle charging stations. Additionally, we considered the implications and necessary steps for establishing a new charging station in Washington state.

# Key Questions 
1) What is the current EV outlook in WA?
2) Growth patterns and types of EV over time?
3) Relations between areas of EV and charging stations

1) Identified and sourced an API or dataset that aligned with our research theme.
2) Devised central questions to narrow our research scope and enhance our analytical focus.
3) Undertook a preliminary data examination, involving cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in line with our research questions.
4) 4) In order to understand the relationships between the ev model and other elements, we performed in-depth data analysis using special modeling techniques.
5) Crafted a conceptual design for a Tableau dashboard, structured around our key questions.
6) Visualized our findings through a range of mediums, including geographic maps and graphical representations.

- Model suggests that income, sex, age doesn't impact total EV ownership, only population

- We recommend installing a supercharger suitable for Telsa, the most popular EV model.

- It is recommended to focus installation in Sammamish City, where there is currently low demand for electric vehicle chargers (1.7 chargers/1,000 EVs).

# Challenges
1) It was difficult to decide on a topic and find APIs and datasets that fit the topic. While there's an abundance of APIs available, pinpointing the exact data we were seeking was no easy task.
2) Developing relationships between different data sources (age, gender, vehicles)
3) Coordinating same data files between partners

# Future Goals
1) Using a variety of parameters to improve model fit
2) Working on EDA process with python to find more pattern between datasets
3) Having more updated, specific  data sets to see if results would.
